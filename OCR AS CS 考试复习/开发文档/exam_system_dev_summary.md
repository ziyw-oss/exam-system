- [x] `parse_pdf.py` extracts questions into `questions` table
- [x] Each question linked to `exam_id`, `chapter_id`
- [x] Handles long-text, multi-part questions

### 🔹 2. PDF OCR + Answer Extraction
- [x] Text extraction tested using `fitz` (PyMuPDF)
- [x] `parse_mark_scheme.py` created to parse official answers
- [ ] Answer matching logic to be enhanced for fuzzy formats

### 🔹 3. Student Progress Tracker
- [x] API to record learning progress (`learning_progress` table)
- [x] Frontend page `learn/progress`
- [x] Score trends chart + keypoint level tracking
