58,"A function, toBinary(), is needed to calculate the binary value of a denary integer between 0 and 255. toBinary() needs to: • take an integer value as a parameter • divide the number by 2 repeatedly, storing a 1 if it has a remainder and a 0 if it doesn’t • combine the remainder values (first to last running right to left) to create the binary number • return the binary number. For example, to convert 25 to a binary number the steps are as follows:  6 / 2 = 3 remainder 0 3 / 2 = 1 remainder 1 1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1 return value = 11001",439,"Conversion between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal."
