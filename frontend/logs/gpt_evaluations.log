    "exemplar": "The candidate gives two valid factors that would affect performance and then explains why each of the two factors would affect performance. They use appropriate terminology in their response.",
    "studentAnswer": "The main factors affecting processor performance are:\nClock speed: The system clock generates a series of signals, switching between 0 and 1 several million times per second and synchronising CPU operation. Each CPU operation starts as the clock changes from 0 to 1( or in some systems from 1 to 0), and the CPU cannot perform operations faster than the clock cycle (the time the clock takes to go from 0 to 1 and back to 0).  All processor activities begin on a clock pulse, although some activities may take more than one clock cycle to complete. One clock cycle per second = 1 Hertz(Hz); clock speed is measured in Gigahertz(Ghz), about 1 billion cycles per second.\nNumber of cores: In a traditional computer, instructions are fetched and executed one at a time in a serial manner. However, many computers nowadays have multiple cores. A dual-core processor has two processors linked together in the same integrated circuit, and a quad-core computer has four linked processors. Each core is theoretically able to process a different instruction at the same time with its own fetch-execute cycle, making the processor two or even four times faster with a quad-core chip. \nAmount and type of memory: Cache is a small amount of expensive, very fast memory inside the CPU. When an instruction is fetched from main memory, it is copied into the caches, so if it is needed again soon after, it can be fetched from the cache, which is much quicker than going back to main memory. As the cache fills up, unused instructions or data still being held are replaced with more recent ones. There are different levels of cache: Level 1 cache is extremely fast but small(between 2-64 KB); Level 2 cache is fairly fast and medium-sized(256 KB- 2 MB); Some CPUS also have Level 3 cache.\n",

    "exemplar": "The candidate gives two valid factors that would affect performance and then explains why each of the two factors would affect performance. They use appropriate terminology in their response.",
    "studentAnswer": "The main factors affecting processor performance are:\nClock speed: The system clock generates a series of signals, switching between 0 and 1 several million times per second and synchronising CPU operation. Each CPU operation starts as the clock changes from 0 to 1( or in some systems from 1 to 0), and the CPU cannot perform operations faster than the clock cycle (the time the clock takes to go from 0 to 1 and back to 0).  All processor activities begin on a clock pulse, although some activities may take more than one clock cycle to complete. One clock cycle per second = 1 Hertz(Hz); clock speed is measured in Gigahertz(Ghz), about 1 billion cycles per second.\nNumber of cores: In a traditional computer, instructions are fetched and executed one at a time in a serial manner. However, many computers nowadays have multiple cores. A dual-core processor has two processors linked together in the same integrated circuit, and a quad-core computer has four linked processors. Each core is theoretically able to process a different instruction at the same time with its own fetch-execute cycle, making the processor two or even four times faster with a quad-core chip. \nAmount and type of memory: Cache is a small amount of expensive, very fast memory inside the CPU. When an instruction is fetched from main memory, it is copied into the caches, so if it is needed again soon after, it can be fetched from the cache, which is much quicker than going back to main memory. As the cache fills up, unused instructions or data still being held are replaced with more recent ones. There are different levels of cache: Level 1 cache is extremely fast but small(between 2-64 KB); Level 2 cache is fairly fast and medium-sized(256 KB- 2 MB); Some CPUS also have Level 3 cache.\n",

    "exemplar": "The candidate gives two valid factors that would affect performance and then explains why each of the two factors would affect performance. They use appropriate terminology in their response.",
    "studentAnswer": "The main factors affecting processor performance are:\nClock speed: The system clock generates a series of signals, switching between 0 and 1 several million times per second and synchronising CPU operation. Each CPU operation starts as the clock changes from 0 to 1( or in some systems from 1 to 0), and the CPU cannot perform operations faster than the clock cycle (the time the clock takes to go from 0 to 1 and back to 0).  All processor activities begin on a clock pulse, although some activities may take more than one clock cycle to complete. One clock cycle per second = 1 Hertz(Hz); clock speed is measured in Gigahertz(Ghz), about 1 billion cycles per second.\nNumber of cores: In a traditional computer, instructions are fetched and executed one at a time in a serial manner. However, many computers nowadays have multiple cores. A dual-core processor has two processors linked together in the same integrated circuit, and a quad-core computer has four linked processors. Each core is theoretically able to process a different instruction at the same time with its own fetch-execute cycle, making the processor two or even four times faster with a quad-core chip. \nAmount and type of memory: Cache is a small amount of expensive, very fast memory inside the CPU. When an instruction is fetched from main memory, it is copied into the caches, so if it is needed again soon after, it can be fetched from the cache, which is much quicker than going back to main memory. As the cache fills up, unused instructions or data still being held are replaced with more recent ones. There are different levels of cache: Level 1 cache is extremely fast but small(between 2-64 KB); Level 2 cache is fairly fast and medium-sized(256 KB- 2 MB); Some CPUS also have Level 3 cache.\n",

    "exemplar": "The candidate gives two valid factors that would affect performance and then explains why each of the two factors would affect performance. They use appropriate terminology in their response.",
    "studentAnswer": "The main factors affecting processor performance are:\nClock speed: The system clock generates a series of signals, switching between 0 and 1 several million times per second and synchronising CPU operation. Each CPU operation starts as the clock changes from 0 to 1( or in some systems from 1 to 0), and the CPU cannot perform operations faster than the clock cycle (the time the clock takes to go from 0 to 1 and back to 0).  All processor activities begin on a clock pulse, although some activities may take more than one clock cycle to complete. One clock cycle per second = 1 Hertz(Hz); clock speed is measured in Gigahertz(Ghz), about 1 billion cycles per second.\nNumber of cores: In a traditional computer, instructions are fetched and executed one at a time in a serial manner. However, many computers nowadays have multiple cores. A dual-core processor has two processors linked together in the same integrated circuit, and a quad-core computer has four linked processors. Each core is theoretically able to process a different instruction at the same time with its own fetch-execute cycle, making the processor two or even four times faster with a quad-core chip. \nAmount and type of memory: Cache is a small amount of expensive, very fast memory inside the CPU. When an instruction is fetched from main memory, it is copied into the caches, so if it is needed again soon after, it can be fetched from the cache, which is much quicker than going back to main memory. As the cache fills up, unused instructions or data still being held are replaced with more recent ones. There are different levels of cache: Level 1 cache is extremely fast but small(between 2-64 KB); Level 2 cache is fairly fast and medium-sized(256 KB- 2 MB); Some CPUS also have Level 3 cache.\n",

    "exemplar": "The candidate gives two valid factors that would affect performance and then explains why each of the two factors would affect performance. They use appropriate terminology in their response.",
    "studentAnswer": "The main factors affecting processor performance are:\nClock speed: The system clock generates a series of signals, switching between 0 and 1 several million times per second and synchronising CPU operation. Each CPU operation starts as the clock changes from 0 to 1( or in some systems from 1 to 0), and the CPU cannot perform operations faster than the clock cycle (the time the clock takes to go from 0 to 1 and back to 0).  All processor activities begin on a clock pulse, although some activities may take more than one clock cycle to complete. One clock cycle per second = 1 Hertz(Hz); clock speed is measured in Gigahertz(Ghz), about 1 billion cycles per second.\nNumber of cores: In a traditional computer, instructions are fetched and executed one at a time in a serial manner. However, many computers nowadays have multiple cores. A dual-core processor has two processors linked together in the same integrated circuit, and a quad-core computer has four linked processors. Each core is theoretically able to process a different instruction at the same time with its own fetch-execute cycle, making the processor two or even four times faster with a quad-core chip. \nAmount and type of memory: Cache is a small amount of expensive, very fast memory inside the CPU. When an instruction is fetched from main memory, it is copied into the caches, so if it is needed again soon after, it can be fetched from the cache, which is much quicker than going back to main memory. As the cache fills up, unused instructions or data still being held are replaced with more recent ones. There are different levels of cache: Level 1 cache is extremely fast but small(between 2-64 KB); Level 2 cache is fairly fast and medium-sized(256 KB- 2 MB); Some CPUS also have Level 3 cache.\n",

The logic of the loop to check each item in sequence for an empty entry is clear, as is the indexing into the 2- Dimensional table structure. To contrast with Exemplar 2, this exemplar shows a lack of pseudocode with a response written mostly in prose English, with inconsistent indentation and a lack of clear variable naming. Assessment for learning Candidates frequently benefit from having extensive practical programming experience when answering pseudocode questions. Past paper questions can provide a context for problems for implementation. For this question candidates could either be asked to code a two dimensional table structure for the data in Fig 1 and to then implement the linear search, or they code be provided with a scaffolded partially complete solution with the table defined and the stem of a function given. Routinely taking past paper questions that can be practically implemented is an effective way to make sure that candidates have relevant experience.",
