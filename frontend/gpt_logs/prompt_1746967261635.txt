Question: * Charlie will use database management software to store customers’ personal and appointment details. Charlie is considering both open source and closed source database software. Compare the differences between open source software and closed source software and recommend which type of database software Charlie should use. You should refer to the following in your answer: • Cost • Usability • Extensibility • Security • Support available .............................................................................................................................................  [9]
Reference Answer: Mark Band 3–High Level
(7-9 marks)
The candidate demonstrates a thorough knowledge and
understanding of open and closed source software; the
material is generally accurate and detailed.
The candidate has covered all 4 sections of cost, usability,
security and Support available and for the top of this mark
band will have covered all 4 well. Evidence/examples will be
explicitly relevant to the explanation.
There is a well-developed line of reasoning which is clear
and logically structured. The information presented is
relevant and substantiated.
Mark Band 2-Mid Level
(4-6 marks)
The candidate demonstrates reasonable knowledge and
understanding of open and closed source software; the
material is generally accurate but at times underdeveloped.
The candidate has covered all at least 2 of the 4 sections of
cost, usability, security and Support available.
Evidence/examples are for the most part implicitly relevant to
the explanation.
There is a line of reasoning presented with some structure.
The information presented is in the most part relevant and
supported by some evidence.
Mark Band 1-Low Level
(1-3 marks)
The candidate demonstrates a basic knowledge of how the
layers of open and closed source software; the material is
basic and contains some inaccuracies.
The candidate makes a limited attempt to apply acquired
knowledge and understanding to the context provided.
The candidate provides nothing more than an unsupported
assertion.
The information is basic and communicated in an
unstructured way. The information is supported by limited
evidence and the relationship to the evidence may not be
clear.

Marking Scheme: Knowledge:
Cost
Open Source
• (generally) free to use
• May have to purchase maintenance
contracts
• Staff training if “non-standard”
Closed Source
• (sometimes) have to pay to license the
software
• If paid will (usually) it will come with some
level of support
Usability/extensibility
Open Source
• Tends to have a lower focus on UI
• Source code released (under license)
• Source can be edited
• Can be redistributed (under license)
Closed Source
• Professionally developed
• Distributed with a restrictive license
• Only executable/object code is
distributed//source code not distributed
• Cannot be redistributed
Security
Open Source
• potentially massive bank of volunteer
developers working on the product
• Many of the contributors may not be
professional
• Code available to be scrutinised by
anyone…
• …but this may include people with
malicious intentions
Closed Source
• Closed teams of developers
• More work scrutiny for code
• security fixes usually addressed quicker
Support Available
Open Source
• Source code released (under license)
• Source can be edited
• Open communities mean lots of support
options could be available
Closed Source
• Support may be available from the
company producing the software.
•
Application:
Cost
Open Source
• Lower overheads to company
• Extra staff training and hardware cost could
lead to total cost of ownership being higher
Closed Source
• Support from vendor can lead to quicker
fixes.
Usability
Open Source
• The ability to edit source code means
bespoke functionality can be developed in
house
• Lower focus on UI can mean a harder to
use product (leading to higher training
costs)
Closed Source
• Due to professional development, finish
tends to be a higher standard
Examiner Report: Candidates were assessed on the quality of their extended response in this question. Most of the candidates were clear on the basic difference between open and closed source software but did not link this in with the scenario. Mid-level responses were common with few candidates having a balanced discussion with coverage of all four of the required sections.

Student's Answer: Cost 
Open Source 
• (generally) free to use 
• May have to purchase maintenance 
contracts 
• Staff training if “non-standard”

software

level of support 
 
Usability/extensibility

• Lower focus on UI can mean a harder to 
use product (leading to higher training 
costs) 
Closed Source 
• Due to professional development, finish 
tends to be a higher standard 
• As the organisation protects their IP they 
generally tend to be less buggy as the 
organisation reputation/business model will 
rely on it 
• Lack of source code means extra features 
can only be developed by the vendor. 
Security 
Open Source 
• Tends to be less secure as more people 
working on it, not always under rigorous 
oversight 
• No paid developers mean people may not 
work on security fixes straight away 
Closed Source 
• Developers work under tighter standards 
• Code being scrutinised more will mean less 
likely to be ship with bugs 
• Professional standards lead to quicker 
turnaround of bugs 
Support Available 
Open Source 
• Editable source code means could self
support 
• Open communities mean there is vast 
amounts of knowledge available. 
Evaluation: 
Open Source 
• Open source would lead to potential cost 
savings if Charlie looked to self support by 
using online communities or handling the 
code herself. 
Closed Source 
• If Charlie lacked technical skills, the better 
UI design from professional developers 
may make the UX smoother 
• Charlies would have a legal obligation to 
the data stored for her business. Closed 
source tighter security may strengthen this  
• Charlies business will rely on the uptime of 
her system. Professional support offered by 
the developers may mean less downtime in 
the case of software issues. 

Step 1: Evaluate the student's answer in terms of relevance, accuracy, and completeness.
Step 2: Rewrite the "correct answer" in a concise, easy-to-remember format that focuses on scoring points. 
Use numbered points (1., 2., etc.) with one key idea per line. 
Avoid unnecessary details or expansions that students don't need to write in exams. 
Example: Use "BIOS" instead of "BIOS (Basic Input Output System)". 
The answer should be short and clear enough to memorize quickly for handwritten response.
Step 3: Return:
- "score": the numerical score (0 to 9)
- "reason": a short explanation for why this score was given.
- "correctAnswer": your version of the ideal answer.

Respond in the following JSON format:
{
  "score": number,
  "reason": "your explanation",
  "correctAnswer": "your rewritten ideal answer"
