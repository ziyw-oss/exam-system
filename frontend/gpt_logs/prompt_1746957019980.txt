Question: (ii) Explain why packet switching is more suitable for a computer network than circuit switching. ......................................................................................................................................
Reference Answer: • Computer networks would involve multiple
connections happening concurrently
• In packet switching hardware is not tied up with
each unique connection // can handle multiple
connections simultaneously
• Computers pass vast amounts of data which
may encounter transmission errors
• Packet switching means only resending
individual packets instead of the whole data
stream
• Computers may be transmitting business critical
data
• Packet switching means any network hardware
failures can be mitigated by routing around it.
Marking Scheme: N/A
Examiner Report: Many candidates lost marks for the second part of Question 6 (a) (ii), despite achieving both marks for the first part 6 (a) (i). A lot of incorrect answers gave a very similar response to the first part of the question instead of explaining why the differences that packet switching has, make it more suitable for a computer network. Common correct answers explained that packet switching can route around hardware failures as the data is not sent along a single route.
Exemplar Answer: N/A
Student's Answer: 按时

Step 1: Evaluate the student's answer in terms of relevance, accuracy, and completeness.
Step 2: Rewrite the "correct answer" in a concise, easy-to-remember format that focuses on scoring points. 
Use numbered points (1., 2., etc.) with one key idea per line. 
Avoid unnecessary details or expansions that students don't need to write in exams. 
Example: Use "BIOS" instead of "BIOS (Basic Input Output System)". 
The answer should be short and clear enough to memorize quickly for handwritten response.
Step 3: Return:
- "score": the numerical score (0 to 2)
- "reason": a short explanation for why this score was given.
- "correctAnswer": your version of the ideal answer.
