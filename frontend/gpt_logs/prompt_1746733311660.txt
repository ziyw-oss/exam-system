Question: * Charlie will use database management software to store customers’ personal and appointment details. Charlie is considering both open source and closed source database software. Compare the differences between open source software and closed source software and recommend which type of database software Charlie should use. You should refer to the following in your answer: • Cost • Usability • Extensibility • Security • Support available .............................................................................................................................................  [9]
Reference Answer: Mark Band 3–High Level
(7-9 marks)
The candidate demonstrates a thorough knowledge and
understanding of open and closed source software; the
material is generally accurate and detailed.
The candidate has covered all 4 sections of cost, usability,
security and Support available and for the top of this mark
band will have covered all 4 well. Evidence/examples will be
explicitly relevant to the explanation.
There is a well-developed line of reasoning which is clear
and logically structured. The information presented is
relevant and substantiated.
Mark Band 2-Mid Level
(4-6 marks)
The candidate demonstrates reasonable knowledge and
understanding of open and closed source software; the
material is generally accurate but at times underdeveloped.
The candidate has covered all at least 2 of the 4 sections of
cost, usability, security and Support available.
Evidence/examples are for the most part implicitly relevant to
the explanation.
There is a line of reasoning presented with some structure.
The information presented is in the most part relevant and
supported by some evidence.
Mark Band 1-Low Level
(1-3 marks)
The candidate demonstrates a basic knowledge of how the
layers of open and closed source software; the material is
basic and contains some inaccuracies.
The candidate makes a limited attempt to apply acquired
knowledge and understanding to the context provided.
The candidate provides nothing more than an unsupported
assertion.
The information is basic and communicated in an
unstructured way. The information is supported by limited
evidence and the relationship to the evidence may not be
clear.

Marking Scheme: Knowledge:
Cost
Open Source
• (generally) free to use
• May have to purchase maintenance
contracts
• Staff training if “non-standard”
Closed Source
• (sometimes) have to pay to license the
software
• If paid will (usually) it will come with some
level of support
Usability/extensibility
Open Source
• Tends to have a lower focus on UI
• Source code released (under license)
• Source can be edited
• Can be redistributed (under license)
Closed Source
• Professionally developed
• Distributed with a restrictive license
• Only executable/object code is
distributed//source code not distributed
• Cannot be redistributed
Security
Open Source
• potentially massive bank of volunteer
developers working on the product
• Many of the contributors may not be
professional
• Code available to be scrutinised by
anyone…
• …but this may include people with
malicious intentions
Closed Source
• Closed teams of developers
• More work scrutiny for code
• security fixes usually addressed quicker
Support Available
Open Source
• Source code released (under license)
• Source can be edited
• Open communities mean lots of support
options could be available
Closed Source
• Support may be available from the
company producing the software.
•
Application:
Cost
Open Source
• Lower overheads to company
• Extra staff training and hardware cost could
lead to total cost of ownership being higher
Closed Source
• Support from vendor can lead to quicker
fixes.
Usability
Open Source
• The ability to edit source code means
bespoke functionality can be developed in
house
• Lower focus on UI can mean a harder to
use product (leading to higher training
costs)
Closed Source
• Due to professional development, finish
tends to be a higher standard
Examiner Report: Candidates were assessed on the quality of their extended response in this question. Most of the candidates were clear on the basic difference between open and closed source software but did not link this in with the scenario. Mid-level responses were common with few candidates having a balanced discussion with coverage of all four of the required sections.
Exemplar Answer: N/A
