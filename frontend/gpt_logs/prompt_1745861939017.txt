You are a professional exam grader. Please evaluate the student's answer based on the following materials. The maximum score is 9.

Question: (ii) * A storage device is used to store the individual video elements while they are being captured in different locations and during the video editing process. Discuss the suitability of a flash storage device and a magnetic storage device for storing the different video elements while they are being collected and edited. You should refer to the following in your answer: • the benefits of each type of storage • the drawbacks of each type of storage • the suitability of each type of storage. ......................................................................................................................................
Reference Answer: Mark Band 3–High Level
(7-9 marks)
The candidate will provide a range of accurate benefits and
drawbacks of both magnetic and flash devices.
The candidate is able to apply their knowledge and
understanding directly and consistently to the context provided.
Evidence/examples will be explicitly relevant to the explanation.
The candidate will come to a clear conclusion that must be
justified by their comments
There is a well-developed line of reasoning which is clear and
logically structured. The information presented is relevant and
substantiated.
Mark Band 2-Mid Level
(4-6 marks)
The candidate will provide drawbacks or benefits about both
magnetic and flash methods. These will be for the most part
relevant. The candidate is able to apply their knowledge and
understanding directly to the context provided although one or
two opportunities are missed.
Evidence/examples are for the most part implicitly relevant to
the explanation.
The candidate will attempt to come to a conclusion, although it
may not be fully justified by their answer,
There is a line of reasoning presented with some structure.
The information presented is in the most part relevant and
supported by some evidence.
Mark Band 1-Low Level
(1-3 marks)
The candidate has provided some drawbacks or benefits of
magnetic or flash methods. The material is basic and contains
some inaccuracies.
The candidate makes a limited attempt to apply acquired
knowledge and understanding to the context provided.
The candidate provides nothing more than an unsupported
assertion.
The information is basic and communicated in an unstructured
way. The information is supported by limited evidence and the
relationship to the evidence may not be clear.

Marking Scheme: AO1
Magnetic Benefits:
• Lower price per GB
• As standard comes in high capacity
Magnetic Drawbacks:
• Lower R/W speed
• Higher power consumption
• Moving parts /less durable
Flash Benefits:
• Higher R/W speed
• No moving parts/more durable
• Lower power consumption
• Can have a higher capacity.
Flash Drawbacks:
• Higher cost per GB
• At higher capacities prices rise exponentially.
AO2:
Suitability of Magnetic:
• Video files are very large, benefiting magnetics low cost
per GB
• Can be used to archive the different video elements after
it’s been rendered
• Could possibly get damaged while being transported
between the different filming sites
• Slow R/W speeds may take it longer to load into the
software
Suitability of flash:
• Very fast R/W speeds therefore reducing the amount of
loading time during the editing process/giving smoother
playback
• If money is not a barrier, flash can be bought in sufficient
capacities for videos.
AO3:
Candidates can conclude either method, but to score in the top
MB must have a clear line of reasoning to justify their choice.
Examiner Report: Candidates were assessed on the quality of their extended response in this question. Most candidates understood the basic differences between flash storage and magnetic storage devices, but did not make clear links to the scenario. Mid-level responses were common, with few candidates giving a balanced discussion and a conclusion with suitable justifications. Assessment for learning Questions with the command word ‘discuss’ require candidates to give a balanced discussion and provided a suitable conclusion which justifies their comments. Opportunities to practise these questions will support candidates to do better on these style questions.
