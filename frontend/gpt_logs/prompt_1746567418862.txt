Examiner Report: Few candidates were given full marks for this question. There was some repetition of checking user input values, which was given in the stem of the question. There were also many statements of possible calculations rather than clearly expressed conditions or questions. More successful responses included decisions such as ‘have buildings of a certain type survived the earthquake?’.
