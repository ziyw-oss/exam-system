[3]
Reference Answer: 1 mark per bullet to max 3
Any reasonable abstraction
e.g.
• will not be to scale not life size
• will exclude features e.g. people, road markings etc
• will only show what is relevant e.g. buildings
Marking Scheme: N/A
Examiner Report: Most candidates demonstrated that they knew what abstraction was, but a significant number struggled to make clear qualified points. Some candidates gave definitions of abstraction as the removal of unnecessary detail, but this did not answer the question. This was a contextual question that required relevant and qualified points. Responses such as ‘the weather’ were insufficient, whereas ‘removal of the effects of weather’ was a valid qualified point.
Exemplar Answer: This exemplar shows a response that has unqualified points that do not show how abstraction can be applied. It highlights factors that could be abstracted, but does not tell us how.
