[4]
Reference Answer: • Clock Speed …
• … The speed at which the fetch decode execute
cycle is completed/ the speed a single core can
execute instructions
• Number of cores/ independent processing units
…
• …that can fetch decode execute at the same
time
• Cache size…
• … memory that contains recently/frequently

• …memory that has a faster R/W speed than
RAM
• …memory that is closer to/onboard the CPU
Marking Scheme: One mark for stating the factor, mark for expanding the
factor
- Accept cycles for “FDE Cycles”
Examiner Report: Most candidates were able to identify two factors that could affect the performance of the CPU, but many were not given all 4 marks as they did not fully describe why each factor would affect the performance. See Exemplar 1, which was given full marks.
Exemplar Answer: The candidate gives two valid factors that would affect performance and then explains why each of the two factors would affect performance. They use appropriate terminology in their response.
