Marking Scheme: N/A
Examiner Report: A pleasingly high number of candidates demonstrated a clear understanding of how a linear search operated and used clear and accurate language. More candidates were clearer in the way that they articulated the steps of the search than in previous series. However, there were still a number of candidates who gave vague responses such as ‘check each value until the value input is found’ that did not articulate the required steps. Some candidates gave advantages or disadvantages of using a linear search but such responses did not answer the question.
