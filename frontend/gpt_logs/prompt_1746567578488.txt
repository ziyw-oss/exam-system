You are a professional exam grader. Please evaluate the student's answer based on the following materials. The maximum score is 2.

Question: (ii) Give one benefit and one drawback of declaring dataArray as a local variable in the main program. Benefit  ............................................................................................................................... Drawback  ..........................................................................................................................
Reference Answer: 1 mark for benefit
e.g.
• Increases data integrity
• More efficient memory usage
• Stops other subroutines accidently altering variable
1 mark for drawback
e.g.
• Cannot be accessed directly by other subroutines
• It has to be passed into a subroutine as a parameter
Marking Scheme: N/A
Examiner Report: Some candidates confused the terms local variable and global variable and gave definitions the wrong way round. A significant number of responses demonstrated conceptual misconceptions. The contents of dataArray could be used in other parts of the program if it was passed as a parameter to a function/procedure, but could not be referenced directly. Responses such as giving ‘can’t be used anywhere else in the program’ as a disadvantage were, therefore, incorrect.
Exemplar Answer: N/A
Student's Answer: Increases data integrity, More efficient memory usage, Stops other subroutines accidently altering variable
