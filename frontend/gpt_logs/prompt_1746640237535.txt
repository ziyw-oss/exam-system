Question: A function findFirst, is used to find the first available appointment. Write the function findFirst that will find the first available appointment and return the booking slot number. If no appointments are available then the function should return "-1". You should write your function using pseudocode or program code. .............................................................................................................................................. [7]
Reference Answer: 1 mark per bullet up to a maximum of 7 marks, e.g.:
• Defining the function correctly
findFirst
• Suitable logic for checking the first time slot
• Suitable logic for checking the next time slot…
• Suitable loop to check all time slots
• Suitable logic for returning the available time slot
• Suitable logic for returning if no time slots
-1
available
• Suitable use of variable names and indentation
Marking Scheme: Example solution:
function findFirst()
count = 0
do
found = false
""
if customerID[2, count] == then
found = true
else
count = count + 1
endif
until count == 10 or found == true
if found == True
return customerID[0,count]
else
return -1
endif
endfunction
There are many different ways that this function could
have been achieved. Therefore other alternative methods
should be given credit.
Examiner Report: A number of candidates started by defining a procedure rather than defining a function. Indentation was not always consistent with the constructs being used. Candidates seemed to have difficulty with referencing two dimensional structures. Algorithms that require two dimensional data frequently appear on this paper and candidates need to have extensive practical programming experience solving problems using these structures.
Exemplar Answer: A well-structured pseudocode response that uses indentation and variable naming well. The logic of the loop to check each item in sequence for an empty entry is clear, as is the indexing into the 2- Dimensional table structure. To contrast with Exemplar 2, this exemplar shows a lack of pseudocode with a response written mostly in prose English, with inconsistent indentation and a lack of clear variable naming. Assessment for learning Candidates frequently benefit from having extensive practical programming experience when answering pseudocode questions. Past paper questions can provide a context for problems for implementation. For this question candidates could either be asked to code a two dimensional table structure for the data in Fig 1 and to then implement the linear search, or they code be provided with a scaffolded partially complete solution with the table defined and the stem of a function given. Routinely taking past paper questions that can be practically implemented is an effective way to make sure that candidates have relevant experience.
