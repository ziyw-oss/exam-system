• ….Segmentation uses logical addressing
• Paging uses fixed size memory blocks….
• …. Segmentation uses variable length memory
blocks
Marking Scheme: Answer must cover paging and segmentation for 2
marks.
Do not accept data instead of memory
Examiner Report: To get both marks, candidates need to be clear that paging and segmentation are about allocating memory. Many candidates were not clear on this and discussed managing data or packets. Candidates should be careful to use the correct terminology for questions of this type in particular.
Exemplar Answer: N/A
Student's Answer: paging uses fixed sized memory blocks memory blocks, segmentation uses variable length memory

Step 3: Return:
- "score": the numerical score (0 to 2)
- "reason": a short explanation for why this score was given.
- "correctAnswer": your version of the ideal answer.
