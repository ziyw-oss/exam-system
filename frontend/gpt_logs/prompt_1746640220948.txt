Examiner Report: Many responses to this question were generalised answers that stated that the sorted variable determined whether the data was sorted or not. This could be an indication that candidates did not have practical experience of implementing a bubble sort with a swap flag. Most candidates did not appreciate the function of the variable during each pass of the bubble sort. Candidates need to be well versed in the different ways of implementing a bubble sort.
