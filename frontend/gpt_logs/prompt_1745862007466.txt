You are a professional exam grader. Please evaluate the student's answer based on the following materials. The maximum score is 2.

Question: (ii) Explain why packet switching is more suitable for a computer network than circuit switching. ......................................................................................................................................
Reference Answer: • Computer networks would involve multiple
connections happening concurrently
• In packet switching hardware is not tied up with
each unique connection // can handle multiple
connections simultaneously
• Computers pass vast amounts of data which
may encounter transmission errors
• Packet switching means only resending
individual packets instead of the whole data
stream
• Computers may be transmitting business critical
data
• Packet switching means any network hardware
failures can be mitigated by routing around it.
Marking Scheme: N/A
Examiner Report: Many candidates lost marks for the second part of Question 6 (a) (ii), despite achieving both marks for the first part 6 (a) (i). A lot of incorrect answers gave a very similar response to the first part of the question instead of explaining why the differences that packet switching has, make it more suitable for a computer network. Common correct answers explained that packet switching can route around hardware failures as the data is not sent along a single route.
