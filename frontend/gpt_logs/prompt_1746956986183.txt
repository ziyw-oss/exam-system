You are a professional exam grader. Please evaluate the student's answer based on the following materials. The maximum score is 4.

Question: Describe two factors that affect the performance of the CPU. 1 ................................................................................................................................................ 2 ................................................................................................................................................ [4]
Reference Answer: • Clock Speed …
• … The speed at which the fetch decode execute
cycle is completed/ the speed a single core can
execute instructions
• Number of cores/ independent processing units
…
• …that can fetch decode execute at the same
time
• Cache size…
• … memory that contains recently/frequently
used instructions/data
• …memory that has a faster R/W speed than
RAM
• …memory that is closer to/onboard the CPU
Marking Scheme: One mark for stating the factor, mark for expanding the
factor
- Accept cycles for “FDE Cycles”
Examiner Report: Most candidates were able to identify two factors that could affect the performance of the CPU, but many were not given all 4 marks as they did not fully describe why each factor would affect the performance. See Exemplar 1, which was given full marks.
Exemplar Answer: The candidate gives two valid factors that would affect performance and then explains why each of the two factors would affect performance. They use appropriate terminology in their response.

Step 1: Evaluate the student's answer in terms of relevance, accuracy, and completeness.
Step 2: Rewrite the "correct answer" in a concise, easy-to-remember format that focuses on scoring points. 
Use numbered points (1., 2., etc.) with one key idea per line. 
Avoid unnecessary details or expansions that students don't need to write in exams. 
Example: Use "BIOS" instead of "BIOS (Basic Input Output System)". 
The answer should be short and clear enough to memorize quickly for handwritten response.
Step 3: Return:
- "score": the numerical score (0 to 4)
- "reason": a short explanation for why this score was given.
- "correctAnswer": your version of the ideal answer.

Respond in the following JSON format:
{
  "score": number,
  "reason": "your explanation",
  "correctAnswer": "your rewritten ideal answer"
