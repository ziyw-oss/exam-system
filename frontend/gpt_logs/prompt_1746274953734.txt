Question: (ii) * A storage device is used to store the individual video elements while they are being captured in different locations and during the video editing process. Discuss the suitability of a flash storage device and a magnetic storage device for storing the different video elements while they are being collected and edited. You should refer to the following in your answer: • the benefits of each type of storage • the drawbacks of each type of storage • the suitability of each type of storage. ......................................................................................................................................

Student's Answer: Flash Storage Device:
	•	Benefits:
– Flash storage (e.g., SSDs, USB drives) is fast, with high read/write speeds.
– It has no moving parts, making it more durable and shock-resistant – ideal for capturing video in different locations.
– Lightweight and portable, which is useful when moving between filming/editing locations.
	•	Drawbacks:
– Generally more expensive per GB compared to magnetic storage.
– Limited number of write cycles (though usually sufficient for video editing tasks).
	•	Suitability:
– Flash storage is highly suitable for capturing video on-location due to speed, durability, and portability. It’s also well-suited for editing, as fast read/write speeds reduce loading and saving times during the editing process.

Magnetic Storage Device:
	•	Benefits:
– Magnetic storage (e.g., HDDs) offers large capacity at a lower cost, making it ideal for storing large video files over time.
– Good for long-term storage of edited footage and backups.
	•	Drawbacks:
– Slower read/write speeds compared to flash storage.
– Contains moving parts, making it more vulnerable to damage from drops or movement.
– Heavier and less portable.
	•	Suitability:
– Magnetic storage is suitable for storing raw video elements and final projects in a central location, but is less practical for mobile use or real-time editing due to slower speeds.
Conclusion:
Both flash and magnetic storage devices have their roles. Flash storage is best for portable, high-speed capturing and editing, while magnetic storage is better suited for cost-effective, high-capacity archival storage. Using both in combination offers the best of both worlds.
