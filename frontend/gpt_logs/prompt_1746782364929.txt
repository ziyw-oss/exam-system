You are a professional exam grader. Please evaluate the student's answer based on the following materials. The maximum score is 2.

Question: When the values are being read from the Sales.txt file they will be a string data type. In order for them to be processed they will need to be cast (i.e. converted) to a different data type. Explain what data type the values in “Sales.txt” should be converted to. .............................................................................................................................................  [2]
Reference Answer: 1 mark per bullet up to a maximum of 2 marks, e.g:
• Float/real/double/single/decimal/currency…
• …because the values in the text file contain a
decimal space…
• …representing monetary values…
• ….the values will be used in calculations
Marking Scheme: N/A
Examiner Report: This was generally answered well although some candidates picked Integer for the data type which would not be accurate given that averages are likely to be a decimal value. There are a range of data types that support decimal values, any of which would be acceptable as an answer.
Exemplar Answer: N/A
Student's Answer: Float because the values in the text file contain a decimal space 

Step 1: Evaluate the student's answer in terms of relevance, accuracy, and completeness.
Step 2: Rewrite the "correct answer" in a concise, easy-to-remember format that reflects the scoring points. Each key point should be on a new line as a bullet (•), to make it easier for students to read and memorize. Avoid unnecessary expansions (e.g., "BIOS (Basic Input Output System)" can be shortened to just "BIOS").
Step 3: Return:
- "score": the numerical score (0 to 2)
- "reason": a short explanation for why this score was given.
- "correctAnswer": your version of the ideal answer.

Respond in the following JSON format:
{

  "reason": "your explanation",
  "correctAnswer": "your rewritten ideal answer"
