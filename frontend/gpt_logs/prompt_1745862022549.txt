Question: An important design consideration is whether OCRSystems use a CISC processor type or a RISC processor type. Describe one difference between a CISC processor and a RISC processor. .............................................................................................................................................. [2]
Reference Answer: • CISC has a larger instruction set
• RISC has a smaller instruction set
• CISC is difficult to pipeline
• RISC is easier to pipeline
• CISC tends to have more addressing modes
• RISC tends to have fewer addressing modes
• CISC instructions may take multiple clock
cycles to execute
• RISC instructions take one clock cycle to
execute
• CISC has complex circuitry/more transistors.
• RISC has less complex/simple circuitry
• CISC uses less RAM
• RISC uses more RAM
Marking Scheme: Accept any other valid points
Mark in pairs

Examiner Report: This question was generally answered well with many candidates describing the number of clock cycles required to execute instructions for RISC and CISC. Some candidates were not given the marks because they did not use the correct terminology.
Exemplar Answer: N/A
Student's Answer: CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computers): A large instruction set is used; understands and executes the series of sub-tasks that make up a single instruction; CISC instruction combines a "load/store" instruction with the instruction that carries out the actual calculation; The code is relatively short, very little RAM is required to store the instructions; Many specialised instructions had to be built into the hardware even though only about 20% of them were used in the average program.
RISC(Reduced Instruction Set Computer): Only simple instructions can be executed; the Compiler has to do more work to translate high-level code into machine code; More RAM is required; Pipelining is possible. Four instructions will executed as fast as the single CISC instruction.

Step 1: Evaluate the student's answer in terms of relevance, accuracy, and completeness.
Step 2: Return:
- "score": the numerical score (0 to 2)
- "reason": a short explanation for why this score was given.
