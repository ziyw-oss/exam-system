Question: OCRSystems are considering using parallel processing in the computer system that will be used for video rendering. Describe how parallel processing would increase the performance of this computer system. .............................................................................................................................................. [3]
Reference Answer: • Parallel processing will allow multiple separate
jobs/instructions/FDE cycles to run concurrently.
• Longer rendering jobs can be split, shortening
the overall time taken.
• Different CPUs/cores can tackle different
frames/sections/components of the video
simultaneously.
Marking Scheme: N/A
