Step 1: Evaluate the student's answer in terms of relevance, accuracy, and completeness.
Step 2: Rewrite the "correct answer" in a concise, easy-to-remember format that focuses on scoring points. 
Use numbered points (1., 2., etc.) with one key idea per line. 
Avoid unnecessary details or expansions that students don't need to write in exams. 
Example: Use "BIOS" instead of "BIOS (Basic Input Output System)". 
The answer should be short and clear enough to memorize quickly for handwritten response.
Step 3: Return:
- "score": the numerical score (0 to 2)
- "reason": a short explanation for why this score was given.
- "correctAnswer": your version of the ideal answer.

Respond in the following JSON format:
{
  "score": number,
  "reason": "your explanation",
  "correctAnswer": "your rewritten ideal answer"
