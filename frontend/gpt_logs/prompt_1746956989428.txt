Question: OCRSystems are considering using parallel processing in the computer system that will be used for video rendering. Describe how parallel processing would increase the performance of this computer system. .............................................................................................................................................. [3]
Reference Answer: • Parallel processing will allow multiple separate
jobs/instructions/FDE cycles to run concurrently.
• Longer rendering jobs can be split, shortening
the overall time taken.
• Different CPUs/cores can tackle different
frames/sections/components of the video
simultaneously.
Marking Scheme: N/A
Examiner Report: To achieve all 3 marks for this question, candidates needed to describe what parallel processing is, and then be clear as to how this would affect the computer system in the question. Many candidates were not given all the available marks as they did not make clear links between parallel processing and the scenario.
Exemplar Answer: N/A
Student's Answer: 按时

Step 1: Evaluate the student's answer in terms of relevance, accuracy, and completeness.
Step 2: Rewrite the "correct answer" in a concise, easy-to-remember format that focuses on scoring points. 
Use numbered points (1., 2., etc.) with one key idea per line. 
Avoid unnecessary details or expansions that students don't need to write in exams. 
Example: Use "BIOS" instead of "BIOS (Basic Input Output System)". 
The answer should be short and clear enough to memorize quickly for handwritten response.
Step 3: Return:
- "score": the numerical score (0 to 3)
- "reason": a short explanation for why this score was given.
- "correctAnswer": your version of the ideal answer.

Respond in the following JSON format:
{
  "score": number,
  "reason": "your explanation",
  "correctAnswer": "your rewritten ideal answer"
