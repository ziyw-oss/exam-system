Student's Answer: How parallel processing would increase the performance of this computer system:
	•	Parallel processing allows multiple instructions or fetch-decode-execute (FDE) cycles to run at the same time.
	•	Longer rendering tasks can be split across multiple cores, reducing overall processing time.
	•	Different CPUs or cores can process different parts of the video (e.g., frames or effects) simultaneously.
