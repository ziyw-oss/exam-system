Reference Answer: • Add a (second outer) loop

set to true at the end of a pass
Marking Scheme: N/A
Examiner Report: Many candidates found it challenging to apply knowledge of a bubble sort to the code given. While a pleasing number identified the need to have an outer loop, there were far fewer who were able to expand on this to explain that this was required to repeat the process for the required number of passes, or until no swaps had occurred during a pass.
