You are a professional exam grader. Please evaluate the student's answer based on the following materials. The maximum score is 2.

Question: When the values are being read from the Sales.txt file they will be a string data type. In order for them to be processed they will need to be cast (i.e. converted) to a different data type. Explain what data type the values in “Sales.txt” should be converted to. .............................................................................................................................................  [2]
Reference Answer: 1 mark per bullet up to a maximum of 2 marks, e.g:
• Float/real/double/single/decimal/currency…
• …because the values in the text file contain a
decimal space…
• …representing monetary values…
• ….the values will be used in calculations
Marking Scheme: N/A
Examiner Report: This was generally answered well although some candidates picked Integer for the data type which would not be accurate given that averages are likely to be a decimal value. There are a range of data types that support decimal values, any of which would be acceptable as an answer.
Exemplar Answer: N/A
Student's Answer: Float because the values in the text file contain a decimal space 

Step 1: Evaluate the student's answer in terms of relevance, accuracy, and completeness.
Step 2: Rewrite the "correct answer" in a concise, easy-to-remember format that focuses on scoring points. 
Use numbered points (1., 2., etc.) with one key idea per line. 
Avoid unnecessary details or expansions that students don't need to write in exams. 
Example: Use "BIOS" instead of "BIOS (Basic Input Output System)". 
The answer should be short and clear enough to memorize quickly for handwritten response.
Step 3: Return:
- "score": the numerical score (0 to 2)
- "reason": a short explanation for why this score was given.
- "correctAnswer": your version of the ideal answer.
