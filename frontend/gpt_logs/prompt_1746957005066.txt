communicate / enter / write down / read.
Marking Scheme: Do not accept Hexadecimal is “easy”
communicate/enter etc…

Use numbered points (1., 2., etc.) with one key idea per line. 
Avoid unnecessary details or expansions that students don't need to write in exams. 
Example: Use "BIOS" instead of "BIOS (Basic Input Output System)". 
The answer should be short and clear enough to memorize quickly for handwritten response.

- "score": the numerical score (0 to 2)
- "reason": a short explanation for why this score was given.
- "correctAnswer": your version of the ideal answer.
