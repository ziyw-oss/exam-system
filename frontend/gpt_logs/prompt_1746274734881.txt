Student's Answer: Step 1: Convert 6.25 to binary
	•	6 = 110
	•	0.25 = 0.01
	•	So 6.25 = 110.01
Step 2: Normalize binary number
	•	Normalized form: 1.1001 \times 2^2
→ Move decimal point 2 places left.
Step 3: Represent mantissa in two’s complement
	•	Normalized mantissa (drop leading 1): 1001
	•	But mantissa needs the leading 1 in the answer.
	•	So mantissa = 1.1001, represented as 0.11001 (we use 5 bits including sign and leading fractional bits).
	•	In two’s complement, the mantissa is positive, so the sign bit is 0.

Mantissa (5 bits): 0.11001
Step 4: Represent exponent in two’s complement
	•	Exponent = 2 → in 3-bit two’s complement: 010

Exponent (3 bits): 010
✅ Final Answer
	•	Mantissa: 0.11001
	•	Exponent: 010
