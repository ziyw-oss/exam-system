Question: (i) A LAN uses packet switching. Describe one difference between packet switching and circuit switching. ......................................................................................................................................
Reference Answer: • In circuit switching dedicated hardware
resources are used for each connection
• In packet switching hardware is used for multiple
different connections.
• In circuit switching the data is sent along one
route/stream.
• In packet switching packets of data may be sent
along multiple different routes/packets may not
be in order
• Circuit switching is less secure if data is
intercepted
• Packet switching, data is more secure if
intercepted/not all packets will be intercepted
Marking Scheme: Marks answers in pairs
