You are a professional exam grader. Please evaluate the student's answer based on the following materials. The maximum score is 2.

Question: An important design consideration is whether OCRSystems use a CISC processor type or a RISC processor type. Describe one difference between a CISC processor and a RISC processor. .............................................................................................................................................. [2]
Reference Answer: • CISC has a larger instruction set
• RISC has a smaller instruction set
• CISC is difficult to pipeline
• RISC is easier to pipeline
• CISC tends to have more addressing modes
• RISC tends to have fewer addressing modes
• CISC instructions may take multiple clock
cycles to execute
• RISC instructions take one clock cycle to
execute
• CISC has complex circuitry/more transistors.
• RISC has less complex/simple circuitry
• CISC uses less RAM
• RISC uses more RAM
Marking Scheme: Accept any other valid points
Mark in pairs

Examiner Report: This question was generally answered well with many candidates describing the number of clock cycles required to execute instructions for RISC and CISC. Some candidates were not given the marks because they did not use the correct terminology.
Exemplar Answer: N/A
Student's Answer: 收到发生的

Step 1: Evaluate the student's answer in terms of relevance, accuracy, and completeness.
Step 2: Rewrite the "correct answer" in a concise, easy-to-remember format that focuses on scoring points. 
Use numbered points (1., 2., etc.) with one key idea per line. 
Avoid unnecessary details or expansions that students don't need to write in exams. 
Example: Use "BIOS" instead of "BIOS (Basic Input Output System)". 
The answer should be short and clear enough to memorize quickly for handwritten response.
Step 3: Return:
- "score": the numerical score (0 to 2)
- "reason": a short explanation for why this score was given.
- "correctAnswer": your version of the ideal answer.

Respond in the following JSON format:
{
  "score": number,
  "reason": "your explanation",
  "correctAnswer": "your rewritten ideal answer"
