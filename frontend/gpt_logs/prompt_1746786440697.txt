You are a professional exam grader. Please evaluate the student's answer based on the following materials. The maximum score is 2.

Question: (ii) Interrupt Service Handlers make use of a stack data structure. Describe how a stack is used when handling interrupts. .....................................................................................................................................
Reference Answer: 1 mark per bullet up to a maximum of 2 marks, e.g:
• Stacks use LIFO/FILO storage
• As processes are halted by an ISR they are pushed
on the stack
• When they are returned, they are popped from the
top of the stack
• So they are returned to in correct order
Marking Scheme: N/A
Examiner Report: Few candidates gained both marks for this question. The concepts of pushing and popping items was mentioned by many candidates although this was often too vague and didn’t link to the question. Candidates needed to use the correct terms for accessing items from a stack to gain the marks in this question.
Exemplar Answer: N/A
Student's Answer: Stacks use LIFO storage as processes are halted by an ISR they are pushed on the stack

Step 1: Evaluate the student's answer in terms of relevance, accuracy, and completeness.
Step 2: Rewrite the "correct answer" in a concise, easy-to-remember format that focuses on scoring points. 
Use numbered points (1., 2., etc.) with one key idea per line. 
Avoid unnecessary details or expansions that students don't need to write in exams. 
Example: Use "BIOS" instead of "BIOS (Basic Input Output System)". 
The answer should be short and clear enough to memorize quickly for handwritten response.
Step 3: Return:
- "score": the numerical score (0 to 2)
- "reason": a short explanation for why this score was given.
- "correctAnswer": your version of the ideal answer.

Respond in the following JSON format:
{
  "score": number,
  "reason": "your explanation",
  "correctAnswer": "your rewritten ideal answer"
