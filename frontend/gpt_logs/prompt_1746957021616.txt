Reference Answer: Mark Band 3–High Level
(7-9 marks)
The candidate demonstrates a thorough knowledge and
understanding of both peer to peer and client server
and can give valid application of both in this scenario.
All detail are generally accurate and relevant
The candidate is able to apply their knowledge and
understanding directly and consistently to the context
provided. Evidence/examples will be explicitly relevant
to the explanation.
There is a well-developed line of reasoning which is
clear and logically structured. The information
presented is relevant and substantiated.
Mark Band 2-Mid Level
(4-6 marks)
The candidate demonstrates reasonable knowledge
and understanding of client server and peer to peer; the
material is generally accurate but at times
underdeveloped. The candidate may not have applied
both to this scenario.
The candidate is able to apply their knowledge and
understanding directly to the context provided although
one or two opportunities are missed.
Evidence/examples are for the most part implicitly
relevant to the explanation.
There is a line of reasoning presented with some
structure. The information presented is in the most part
relevant and supported by some evidence.
Mark Band 1-Low Level
(1-3 marks)
The candidate demonstrates a basic knowledge of
client/server or peer to peer and has made some
attempt at applying this knowledge. the material is basic
and contains some inaccuracies.
The candidate makes a limited attempt to apply
acquired knowledge and understanding to the context
provided.
The candidate provides nothing more than an
unsupported assertion.
The information is basic and communicated in an
unstructured way. The information is supported by
limited evidence and the relationship to the evidence
may not be clear.

Marking Scheme: AO1
P2P:
• Each computer can act independently
• Each computer is responsible for it’s own
security and login
• Each computer will maintain and possibly share
its own connected hardware (printer/external
storage/internet connection)
• Each computer will maintain and possibly share
its own secondary storage
• If a computer is powered down it’s shared
resources will not be available.
• There are no resources not shared by a peer
machine
• Adding a machine is simple
• Very little administration is needed
Client Server:
• All network functionality can be provided by
servers.
• A server is a process running on a machine,
usually dedicated to providing these services.
• A server machine is designed to never be
powered down.
• Login/security is handled centrally
• Shared storage may be managed by a server
• Shared resources (printer/internet connection
etc) my be managed by a server
• If a server process or machine fails, network
functionality, including the ability login is lost
• Adding a new machine can mean installing
specialist client software and setting up OS
policies.
• IT skills and a lot of time are needed to
administer a client server network
AO2
P2P:
• As Zak is looking to expand his staff, P2P would
offer flexibility in adding staff ad hoc.
• Zak’s company is still small and may struggle to
pay for the IT administrator skills needed for a
client server
Client Server:
• As Zak’s firm is an accountancy firm it will have
sensitive customer data
• Client server would allow stronger centralised
security
• As Zak is taking on multiple staff, they may wish
to work collaboratively, which shared storage
would allow.
• Zak could share a single printer/other hardware
with all staff and not worry about an individual
computer being switched on.
Examiner Report: Candidates were assessed on the quality of their extended response in this question. Although most candidates were able to give a few advantages and disadvantages of the different types of network, few made suitable links to the scenario. Some candidates discussed different topologies which was not relevant to the question. Candidates that were given high marks for this question focused more on the scenario, and made clear links between this and the benefits and drawbacks of the different solutions.
Exemplar Answer: The candidate response is well structured. The candidate has firstly highlighted how the computers are connected for each type of network and discussed the advantages and disadvantages. The advantages and disadvantages are well balanced and there are clear links to the scenario throughout. The candidate has made a recommendation on the most suitable type of network for the scenario, highlighting the key advantages and showing clear reasoning. The conclusion emphasises the key points and gives a clear justification.
Student's Answer: 手打

Step 1: Evaluate the student's answer in terms of relevance, accuracy, and completeness.
Step 2: Rewrite the "correct answer" in a concise, easy-to-remember format that focuses on scoring points. 
Use numbered points (1., 2., etc.) with one key idea per line. 
Avoid unnecessary details or expansions that students don't need to write in exams. 
Example: Use "BIOS" instead of "BIOS (Basic Input Output System)". 
The answer should be short and clear enough to memorize quickly for handwritten response.
Step 3: Return:
- "score": the numerical score (0 to 9)
- "reason": a short explanation for why this score was given.
- "correctAnswer": your version of the ideal answer.

Respond in the following JSON format:
{
  "score": number,
  "reason": "your explanation",
  "correctAnswer": "your rewritten ideal answer"
