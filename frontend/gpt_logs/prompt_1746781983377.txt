Question: Arnold has a PC which has a Basic Input Output System (BIOS). Describe what is meant by the term ‘BIOS’. .............................................................................................................................................  [2]
Reference Answer: 1 mark per bullet up to a maximum of 2 marks, e.g:
• Stored in ROM
• Tests hardware/components (are working)
• Boots up the operating system
Marking Scheme: Accept description of POST/Power On Self Test
for BP2
Accept loads up instead of boots up (BP3)
Examiner Report: This was generally answered well, although some candidates were vague in their response. The concept of the BIOS booting up the Operating System was missed by some, but most candidates mentioned the BIOS checking that the hardware is operational (POST).
Exemplar Answer: checks hardware and has provided a suitable example. The second mark has been awarded for explaining that the BIOS loads the operating system. Although it was not essential to mention POST (Power-On-Self-Test) this is useful to explain the process that occurs.
Student's Answer: basic input/output system
