You are a professional exam grader. Please evaluate the student's answer based on the following materials. The maximum score is 4.

Question: Show each stage of a bubble sort to sort this data into ascending numerical order: 7 You should clearly show and label each pass in your answer. .............................................................................................................................................. [4]
Reference Answer: 1 mark per bullet
• 1st swap of 5 and 3
• Remainder of first pass
• Pass 2
• Pass 3
1 5 3 9 2 7
1 3 5 9 2 7
1 3 5 2 9 7
1 3 5 2 7 9 End of pass 1
1 3 2 5 7 9 End of pass 2
1 2 3 5 7 9 End of pass 3
Marking Scheme: Candidates do not need to show each
swap, so if the candidate has clearly shown
the end of pass 1, they have met the first
two marking points.
Marks can be awarded for correctly
showing the results of each pass.
Examiner Report: Most candidates clearly showed the steps that would take place in a bubble sort for the date given, with most achieving full marks. Some candidates did not explicitly label each pass as required in the question, but marks were given where the passes could be implied. Few candidates described the principles of a bubble sort instead of applying it to the data given.
