Question: (i) Explain why the procedure bubbleSort accepts the array numbers by reference and not by value. ......................................................................................................................................
Reference Answer: 1 mark per bullet
• by reference will reorder the contents of the array
• …so the new order can be accessed by the main
program // so will be saved when the procedure ends
• by value will change the array only in this procedure
• … and so would need to return the array.
Marking Scheme: N/A
Examiner Report: Many candidates struggled to go beyond recall of definitions for calling by reference and calling by value and struggled to apply it to the code given and to provide a detailed explanation. The bubble sort was defined as a procedure and not a function, so if numbers had been passed by value, a copy of the array would have been passed, and any changes made would not have been kept after the procedure had completed execution.
