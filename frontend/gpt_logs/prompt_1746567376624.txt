You are a professional exam grader. Please evaluate the student's answer based on the following materials. The maximum score is 3.

Question: (iii) State the purpose of the variable holdValue in the procedure bubbleSort. ......................................................................................................................................
Reference Answer: • To temporarily hold a value (for numbers[x])…
• …while it is being transferred from one position to
another…
• ….in the array numbers
• To stop values over writing each other
Marking Scheme: N/A
Examiner Report: Many candidates found it difficult to explain the purpose of the holdValue variable in context. Where candidates achieved some of the marks, they most frequently identified holdValue as a temporary store that was required to prevent accidental overwriting of data during the swap process. Relatively few were able to accurately describe how the variable allowed the contents of dataArray[x] and dataArray[x+1] to be swapped.
Exemplar Answer: This exemplar very clearly states exactly how and why the variable holdValue is required.
