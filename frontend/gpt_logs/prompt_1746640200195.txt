[4]
Reference Answer: 1 mark per bullet up to a maximum of 2 marks for each advantage (4
marks in total), e.g.:
• Saves times (1) as code does not need to be rewritten (1)
• Code may already be tested (1) which will therefore save
development//debugging time (1)
• More efficient code (1) which will use less memory//be easier
to maintain (1)
• May require less technical knowledge (1) as code can used
rather than written (1)
Marking Scheme: Award a maximum of two marks for each
advantage.
Allow other suitable examples.
