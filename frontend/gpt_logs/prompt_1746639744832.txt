Question: Nina is writing a computer game using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Her friend, James, is writing a computer game using a text-editor which will allow James to create and edit text. James will use a separate compiler. Discuss the differences between writing and debugging a program using an IDE and a text-editor. You should include the following in your answer: • features that are used when writing code • features that are used when debugging code • the benefits of using an IDE instead of a text-editor. .....................................................................................................................................................

Reference Answer: Mark Band 3–High Level
(7-9 marks)
The candidate demonstrates thorough knowledge and
understanding of IDEs; the material is generally accurate and
detailed.
The candidate is able to apply their knowledge and
understanding directly and consistently to the context provided.
Evidence/examples will be explicitly relevant to the explanation.
The candidate provides a thorough discussion which is well-
balanced. Evaluative comments are consistently relevant and
well-considered.
There is a well-developed line of reasoning which is clear and
logically structured. The information presented is relevant and
substantiated.
Mark Band 2-Mid Level
(4-6 marks)
The candidate demonstrates reasonable knowledge and
understanding of IDEs; the material is generally accurate but at
times underdeveloped.
The candidate is able to apply their knowledge and
understanding directly to the context provided although one or
two opportunities are missed. Evidence/examples are for the
most part implicitly relevant to the explanation.
The candidate provides a reasonable discussion, the majority
of which is focused. Evaluative comments are for the most part
appropriate, although one or two opportunities for development
are missed.
There is a line of reasoning presented with some structure. The
information presented is in the most part relevant and
supported by some evidence.
Mark Band 1-Low Level
(1-3 marks)
The candidate demonstrates a basic knowledge of IDEs, with
limited understanding shown; the material is basic and contains
some inaccuracies. The candidate makes a limited attempt to
apply acquired knowledge and understanding to the context
provided.
The candidate provides a limited discussion which is narrow in
focus. Judgments if made are weak and unsubstantiated.
The information is basic and communicated in an unstructured
way. The information is supported by limited evidence and the
relationship to the evidence may not be clear.

Marking Scheme: AO1: Knowledge and Understanding
e.g.
IDE:
• pretty print / syntax highlighting
• auto-complete
• auto-correction
• breakpoints
• stepping
Editor:
• no helpful writing/debugging features
• no excess features/interface
AO2.1: Application
e.g.
IDE
• identify syntax errors as writing
• …saves trying to find them
• easier debugging as can step through a program
• auto-indenting avoids errors from incorrect
indentation
• May have built in unit testing to automate testing
and avoid new errors being introduced.
Editor
• does not offer suggestions on code corrections
• Has a lower footprint on memory/CPU which
may be suited to quick alterations or working on
lowed spec’d systems.
• May be better when learning to program as it
forces the user to type everything in full / doesn’t
give suggestions, helping things stick in
memory.
AO3.3: Evaluation
e.g.
• IDE is helpful in reducing original errors
• IDE is helpful in finding and correcting errors
• Editor is a simpler system to use e.g. less
memory needed to run it, does not try and auto-
correct incorrectly or introduce errors that the
programmer has not made.
Examiner Report: A pleasing number of candidates could identify and describe a range of features of an IDE, with most being able to demonstrate sufficient knowledge to achieve mark band Level 2. Few candidates displayed a level of evaluative reasoning of sufficient depth to achieve mark band Level 3. More successful responses clearly explained how relevant debugging tools in an IDE led to much greater productivity than a text editor because of the way that they could assist with finding logical errors in code through the use of stepping and tracing. An acknowledgement of the amount of system resources and the complexity of some IDE environments was less often evaluated. Candidates need to focus on making clear logical arguments with evidence of evaluation (AO3) to be able to achieve mark band 3.
