Question: The algorithm that Layla has written has many errors. Identify the line number of four different errors and write the corrected line of code. Error 1 line number ...................... Error 1 correction  ...................................................................................................................... Error 2 line number ...................... Error 2 correction  ...................................................................................................................... Error 3 line number ...................... Error 3 correction  ...................................................................................................................... Error 4 line number ...................... Error 4 correction  ...................................................................................................................... [4]
Reference Answer: 1 mark for each line and correction
• Line 01
total = 0
• Line 02
• smallest = dataArray[0]
• Line 04
for x = 0 to 19 (accept 20)
• Line 07
if dataArray[x] > largest then
• Line 14
print("Average = " + total / 20)
Marking Scheme: Do not award a mark for the line number
alone without correction.
