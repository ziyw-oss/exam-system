  "6(b)": "Candidates were assessed on the quality of their extended response in this question. Although most candidates were able to give a few advantages and disadvantages of the different types of network, few made suitable links to the scenario. Some candidates discussed different topologies which was not relevant to the question. Candidates that were given high marks for this question focused more on the scenario, and made clear links between this and the benefits and drawbacks of the different solutions. The candidate response is well structured. The candidate has firstly highlighted how the computers are connected for each type of network and discussed the advantages and disadvantages. The advantages and disadvantages are well balanced and there are clear links to the scenario throughout. The candidate has made a recommendation on the most suitable type of network for the scenario, highlighting the key advantages and showing clear reasoning. The conclusion emphasises the key points and gives a clear justification.",
  "1(a)": "Most candidates were able to identify two factors that could affect the performance of the CPU, but many were not given all 4 marks as they did not fully describe why each factor would affect the performance. See Exemplar 1, which was given full marks. The candidate gives two valid factors that would affect performance and then explains why each of the two factors would affect performance. They use appropriate terminology in their response.",
  "1(b)": "This question was generally answered well with many candidates describing the number of clock cycles required to execute instructions for RISC and CISC. Some candidates were not given the marks because they did not use the correct terminology.",
  "1(c)": "To achieve all 3 marks for this question, candidates needed to describe what parallel processing is, and then be clear as to how this would affect the computer system in the question. Many candidates were not given all the available marks as they did not make clear links between parallel processing and the scenario.",
  "1(d)": "This question was generally answered well. Some candidates were not given the second mark as they did not make reference to the operating system.",
  "1(e) (i)": "Many candidates answered this question correctly, with most selecting a monitor/screen and headphones/speakers which were both valid responses.",
  "1(e) (ii)": "Candidates were assessed on the quality of their extended response in this question. Most candidates understood the basic differences between flash storage and magnetic storage devices, but did not make clear links to the scenario. Mid-level responses were common, with few candidates giving a balanced discussion and a conclusion with suitable justifications. Assessment for learning Questions with the command word ‘discuss’ require candidates to give a balanced discussion and provided a suitable conclusion which justifies their comments. Opportunities to practise these questions will support candidates to do better on these style questions.",
  "2(a) (i)": "Most candidates correctly identified that a queue is a ‘First in First Out’ data structure.",
  "2(a) (ii)": "This question was generally answered well with most candidates achieving both marks. Some candidates did not correctly dequeue from the front of the queue, or enqueue to the rear.",
  "2(b) (i)": "Many candidates were given full marks for this question, although some did not correctly return ‘item’ and incorrectly stated ‘items’ would be returned.",
  "2(b) (ii)": "Although some candidates answered this question well, others were only given 1 or 2 of the available 7 marks. Many candidates that lost marks did not push and/or pop characters correctly, and many did not return a value for the final mark. Candidates should also be reminded that the correct spelling and case of identifiers are required in questions of this type. Some candidates added spaces in identifier names or used a different case to the identifiers stated in the question and therefore, were not given marks. Assessment for learning Candidates need to understand the importance of maintaining the spelling, case and use of spaces etc in identifiers in questions which ask for functions to be written.",
  "3(a)": "Most candidates were given at least 1 mark for this question. Some did not gain the second mark as they missed stating that each character has a unique binary value.",
  "3(b) (i)": "This question was generally answered well. Candidates tended to be awarded either full or no marks. If the working was correct for calculating the denary value, the response was usually correct as this only required simple addition.",
  "3(b) (ii)": "Many candidates achieved 1 mark for this question. Many candidates correctly stated that hexadecimal numbers are easier/faster to read/write, but were not given the second mark as they didn’t state that hexadecimal numbers are shorter than binary numbers.",
  "3(c)": "Many candidates were given the first mark by working out the fixed-point equivalent of 6.25 (0110.01) but were not given further marks because they did not read the question correctly. The question states the response must use as few bits as possible. Although some candidates correctly calculated the mantissa, many had extra digits in the exponent which could have been removed. See Exemplar 2 which was given full marks. The candidate clearly shows the fixed-point value of 6.25 to gain the first mark. The second mark is given for showing the mantissa with six bits and the final mark for showing the exponent with three bits. All of these values are displayed clearly, and the candidate uses arrows to demonstrate the movement of the decimal point as additional working.",
  "3(d)": "This question was not answered well as many candidates seemed to misread the question. The majority of candidates that answered this question correctly stated that normalised form allowed for greater accuracy/precision from the number of bits.",
  "4(a)": "This question was generally answered well, although some candidates did not use the correct terminology and therefore could not be given all the available marks.",
  "4(b)": "This question required candidates to correctly draw the relationships between the entities as explained in the question. Candidates were expected to indicate the relationships. Some candidates used either words or other symbols to indicate the relationships, therefore not achieving either of the available marks. Some candidates used a link entity to avoid a many to many relationship between product and order or indicated a relationship of one product to many orders. Either of these responses were acceptable. Assessment for learning Appendices 5c in the specification shows the symbols used for entities and their relationships. Students need to be taught these to use in the exam.",
  "4(c) (i)": "Many candidates were able to state what a primary key is, but did not state the difference between this and a foreign key and therefore did not achieve both marks.",
  "4(c) (ii)": "This question was generally answered well, although some candidates lost marks for mis-spelling the foreign key or adding spaces, both of which are not permitted.",
  "4(c) (iii)": "This question was generally answered well with many candidates gaining the mark.",
  "5(a)": "This question was answered well, although some candidates stated the role of cache rather than RAM. Misconception That RAM and cache are the same thing within a computer system.",
  "5(b)": "Most candidates achieved both of the available marks for this question and linked the scenario in well when writing their response.",
  "6(a) (i)": "Many candidates achieved both marks for this question with most of the responses describing the different routes taken by the data. The candidates who did less well on this question did not understand differences between packet switching and circuit switching.",
  "6(a) (ii)": "Many candidates lost marks for the second part of Question 6 (a) (ii), despite achieving both marks for the first part 6 (a) (i). A lot of incorrect answers gave a very similar response to the first part of the question instead of explaining why the differences that packet switching has, make it more suitable for a computer network. Common correct answers explained that packet switching can route around hardware failures as the data is not sent along a single route."
