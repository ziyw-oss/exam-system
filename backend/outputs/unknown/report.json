  "1": "Nearly all candidates could identify an additional sorting algorithm with the most common response being ‘Insertion sort’. 8 © OCR 2023 AS Level Computer Science - H046/02 - Summer 2023 Examiners’ report",
  "2": "Many candidates successfully identified another model of software development. The most popular responses were Agile and Rapid Application Development. Fewer candidates were then able to go on to describe features of the model they had selected.",
  "3": "A pleasing number of candidates could identify and describe a range of features of an IDE, with most being able to demonstrate sufficient knowledge to achieve mark band Level 2. Few candidates displayed a level of evaluative reasoning of sufficient depth to achieve mark band Level 3. More successful responses clearly explained how relevant debugging tools in an IDE led to much greater productivity than a text editor because of the way that they could assist with finding logical errors in code through the use of stepping and tracing. An acknowledgement of the amount of system resources and the complexity of some IDE environments was less often evaluated. Candidates need to focus on making clear logical arguments with evidence of evaluation (AO3) to be able to achieve mark band 3. 12 © OCR 2023 AS Level Computer Science - H046/02 - Summer 2023 Examiners’ report",
  "4": "Candidates found Question 4 (b) easier to approach than Question 4 (a). Most could write pseudocode to accept a user input. When validating the input to be a value between 1 and 255, there was incorrect use of relational operators with off-by-one errors on occasion. There was also incorrect use of logical operators where or was used instead of and, and vice-versa. When candidates called toBinary(inputVal), the result was not always stored for later use. Assessment for learning When preparing candidates for the examination, they will benefit from a wide range of programming experience. Questions such as 4 (a) and 4 (b) present an ideal opportunity for developing coded solutions to test and discuss before looking at how the algorithms could be presented as pseudocode. 14 © OCR 2023 AS Level Computer Science - H046/02 - Summer 2023 Examiners’ report",
  "5": "Some candidates confused the terms local variable and global variable and gave definitions the wrong way round. A significant number of responses demonstrated conceptual misconceptions. The contents of dataArray could be used in other parts of the program if it was passed as a parameter to a function/procedure, but could not be referenced directly. Responses such as giving ‘can’t be used anywhere else in the program’ as a disadvantage were, therefore, incorrect. 17 © OCR 2023 AS Level Computer Science - H046/02 - Summer 2023 Examiners’ report",
  "6": "Candidates need to be mindful of the fact that an array is a static data structure with a predetermined size. This meant that responses that explained how lists could be used to append and remove items were not given marks. This is an area where candidates who only have programming experience of using lists in Python often struggle. Implementing a stack in an array requires a stack pointer. Those candidates who appreciated this and who clearly had practical experience of modelling push()/pop() operations on a stack were able to articulate how the stack would access array locations at the stack pointer. Exemplar 3 This exemplar was one of the few responses to show a clear insight as to how an array can be used to store and access a stack. It makes it clear that a stack pointer is required and goes on to explain how the stack pointer is manipulated when push()/pop() operations are performed. 19 © OCR 2023 AS Level Computer Science - H046/02 - Summer 2023 Examiners’ report Misconception Many candidates were not clear about the difference between an array and a list: • An array is a static structure whose size cannot be changed. • Lists are dynamic and support items being removed or appended. 20 © OCR 2023 Supporting you Teach Make sure you visit our secure website Teach Cambridge to find the full range of resources and support for the subjects you teach.
