Few candidates could develop the concept of modularity to the level of interfaces and the need for agreed standards for function calls and return values. Most responses focused on the basics of the use of functions and procedures but did not demonstrate how different modules might be integrated."

The logic of the loop to check each item in sequence for an empty entry is clear, as is the indexing into the 2- Dimensional table structure. To contrast with Exemplar 2, this exemplar shows a lack of pseudocode with a response written mostly in prose English, with inconsistent indentation and a lack of clear variable naming. Assessment for learning Candidates frequently benefit from having extensive practical programming experience when answering pseudocode questions. Past paper questions can provide a context for problems for implementation. For this question candidates could either be asked to code a two dimensional table structure for the data in Fig 1 and to then implement the linear search, or they code be provided with a scaffolded partially complete solution with the table defined and the stem of a function given. Routinely taking past paper questions that can be practically implemented is an effective way to make sure that candidates have relevant experience."
